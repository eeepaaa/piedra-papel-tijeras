# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## v1.0
 
Spanish version of the project assigned per TOP's request. It is to be played through the browser's Console.

When I was assigned this project, I must admit I did not know where to even begin. I looked at other people's finished code and everything seemed unintelligible. I read forums, chat-rooms, etc., and I still didn't know where to start. 

After spending, roughly, about 1h and 30min reading through the instructions over and over. I decided to open up a blank document and just fill it in with whatever came to mind. And fortunately enough, good things came to mind... good, messy things came to mind. 

I'm thankful I was intruduced to the concept of git early on; it was of great help when I began to declutter my code. Using git along with the browser's Dev Tools took a huge portion of my time developing the code from stratch; I'd say I spent 30% of the time it took me to finish the project writing the actual code, and 70% debugging/decluttering it. 

I was sadly not able to make use of loops. I did not research properly, thus I ended up repeating the code several times throughout the function. 

## v1.1

I modified the .js file to make proper use of loops. 

## v2.0

I added a visual interface using both HTML and CSS. This time around I edited the code properly thus resulting in significantly less bugs overall when I tried to adjust minor details. 

I also realized I was fixated on the use of the 'flex' property, which at times turned counter-productive. I've now got a better understanding of the 'width', 'height', 'padding' and 'margin' properties as well as making proper use of the 'absolute' and 'relative' values of the position property. And last but not least, how to avoid margin-collapse. 

I had a very easy and fun time using the 'grid' property. I think making use of it can significantly speed things up when designing the visual layout. 

Unfortunately at this time I was not able to properly implement JavaScript. I will review my notes and do further research on the matter before attempting to apply .js so users can intereact with it. 

## v2.1

I've finally implemented JavaScript! The game will now start after pressing the play button.

* Game can no longer be played through the console log. 
* The game does not have a responsive layout as of right now, so it might look slightly 'off' if displayed on larger/smaller screens. 

### NOTE: The game is to be played in Spanish.
