# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## v1.0
 
Spanish version of the project assigned per TOP's request. It is to be played through the browser's Console.

When I was assigned this project, I must admit I did not know where to even begin. I looked at other people's finished code and everything seemed unintelligible. I read forums, chat-rooms, etc., and I still didn't know where to start. 

After spending, roughly, about 1h and 30min reading through the instructions over and over. I decided to open up a blank document and just fill it in with whatever came to mind. And fortunately enough, good things came to mind... good, messy things came to mind. 

I'm thankful I was intruduced to the concept of git early on; it was of great help when I began to declutter my code. Using git along with the browser's Dev Tools took a huge portion of my time developing the code from stratch; I'd say I spent 30% of the time it took me to finish the project writing the actual code, and 70% debugging/decluttering it. 

I was sadly not able to make use of loops. I did not research properly, thus I ended up repeating the code several times throughout the function. 

## v1.1

I modified the .js file to make proper use of loops. 

## v2.0

I added a visual interface using both HTML and CSS. This time around I edited the code properly thus resulting in significantly less bugs overall when I tried to adjust minor details. 

I also realized I was fixated on the use of the 'flex' property, which at times turned counter-productive. I've now got a better understanding of the 'width', 'height', 'padding' and 'margin' properties as well as making proper use of the 'absolute' and 'relative' values of the position property. 

I had a very easy and fun time using the 'grid' property. I think making use of it can significantly speed things up when designing the visual layout. 

The actual page is an absolute overkill, but I just wanted to practice and make use of every concept I've learnt so far. I also decided to add an instructions section because I thought it could serve as practice for whatever concept I might or might need to practice in the future.

Unfortunately at this time I was not able to properly implement JavaScript. I will review my notes and do further research on the matter before attempting to apply .js so users can intereact with it. 

### NOTE: The game is to be played in Spanish.
