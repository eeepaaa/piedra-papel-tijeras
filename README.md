# Rock, Paper, Scissors


Spanish version of the project assigned per TOP's request. It is to be played through the browser's Console.

When I was assigned this project, I must admit I did not know where to even begin. I looked at other people's finished code and everything seemed unintelligible. I read forums, chat-rooms, etc., and I still didn't know where to start. 

After spending, roughly, about 1h and 30min reading through the instructions over and over. I decided to open up a blank document and just fill it in with whatever came to mind. And fortunately enough, good things came to mind... good, messy things came to mind. 

I'm thankful I was intruduced to the concept of git early on; it was of great help when I began to declutter my code. Using git along with the browser's Dev Tools took a huge portion of my time developing the code from stratch; I'd say I spent 30% of the time it took me to finish the project writing the actual code, and 70% debugging/decluttering it. 

I was sadly not able to make use of loops. I did not research properly, thus I ended up repeating the code several times throughout the function. 

NOTE: The game is to be played in Spanish.
